1. repo level: graph the files as cards. edges show which files reference each other. 

   2. file-level: parse out functions, include/import statements, others? into separate code boxes

    3. low-level ast: parse a given function to complete ast. 
        - if we collapse a node and its children, could a codebox card take its place?
